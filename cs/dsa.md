# Algorithms and Data Structures

A distillation of some of the most elegant ideas in computer science and mathematics. The collection is currently skewed towards ideas that showcase cool ways to design algorithms and data structures. Some of the links are to notes hosted on notion. Such links have been marked with an asterisk. Finally, notes that evolved into full fledged libraries or binaries have the appropriate badges next to them.
